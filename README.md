# Forecast_US_Election_YS6431

This repo contains code and data for forecasting the US 2020 presidential election. It was created by Yi Su. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the results of a statistical model that we built. Some data is unable to be shared publicly. We detail how to get that below. The sections of this repo are: inputs, outputs, scripts.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. Since they are not to be shared publicly, not input has been pushed to Github.
We use two datasets: 

- [Survey data - Survey Data thankfully obtained from Democracy Fund and UCLA Nationscape dataset, requested from: 'https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/nationscape-data-set'.]

- [ACS data - America Community Survey dataset from IPUMS: https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml]

Outputs the report and supporting material.

- US-Election_Yi Su.Rmd and .pdf, 
- model3.rds, resultant model

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. These are:

- 01_data_cleaning.R
- 02_data_preparation.R
